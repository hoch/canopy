# Canopy

When you build something bigger than a toy demo with Web Audio API, being able to test and verify is crucial. Canopy provide you with visual tools for prototyping, testing and verification for Web Audio development.


## What does it do?

Canopy is a collection of Web Audio API development tools featuring:
  - Interactive Waveform inspector with seamless zoom in/out.
  - Interactive audiograph visualization.
  - Web Audio API code editor with
      + Auto completion
      + Gist integration
      + Embedded AudioContext configuration
  - Ranged playback with looping.
  - Download rendered audio as 16-bit WAV file.


## How did you do?

For the most part, Canopy is built with [Spiral](https://github.com/hoch/spiral) and [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/). Also a bit of snippets from [WAAX](http://hoch.github.io/WAAX/) as well.


## Aw snap!

Canopy currently works on Chrome and Edge. I will resolve the compatibility issue in the near future. Better yet, if you have the fix for other browsers, feel free to submit a PR!
